So I will start off by saying that the releases made during the last year have been minimal. This is mainly due to a few things. One of these is that I have been focusing as much time on the Ruby rewrite. The others are answering questions and issues in the forum, but also my day job has become more demanding.

### SOME NEW WEBSITE FEATURES:

#### NEW DOCUMENTATION.

One of the downsides has been the lack of good quality documentation, well this is about to change. The New Web design now incorporates existing tools to generate and organise our documentation better and allow easier navigation and searching through all pages/sections. But our documentation needs your help, so why not become a member of the Docs Team and start creating and auditing pages now!

To join the Docs team, please contact WNODDIN (Wiki Team Leader) or me and either of us will add you to the team.

#### DISQUS COMMENTING SYSTEM

All our articles will now have the ability of adding your comments by the powerful Disqus Commenting system. Check out more on what Disqus can do on there website @ http://disqus.com/

#### FULLY INTEGRATED FORUM

The Forum is now fully integrated into the website. This helps make the site feel more connected and allows user syncing between software systems.

There are also many other features and additions that you will spot along the way and we hope you enjoy them.

I would also like to thank everyone who have donated to MyITCRM. Your donations are greatly appreciated.

#### WHEN WILL THE NEXT RELEASE BE?

There is no set date for the next release. There is some critical features we need to add to make this one of the final releases that will put it into the Stable release category and move MyITCRM 1 out of Beta phase.
